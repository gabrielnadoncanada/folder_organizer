# Desktop File Organizer

## Introduction
Desktop File Organizer is a Python Tkinter-based application designed to help users efficiently organize their files and folders. It categorizes files by their types into separate folders, provides options for backing up files before organization, and features a robust undo functionality that allows users to revert to a specific organization state based on historical actions.

## Features
- **File Organization**: Automatically sorts files into folders based on file extensions.
- **Backup Creation**: Option to create a backup of files before organizing them, stored with a timestamp for easy recovery.
- **Undo Functionality**: Allows users to select and undo organization actions from a history of changes, reverting files to their previous states.
- **Interactive GUI**: User-friendly graphical interface that makes it easy to use and accessible for all users.
- **Customizable Exclusions**: Exclude specific files from being organized, such as the script file itself.
